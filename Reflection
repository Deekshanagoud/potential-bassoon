Good afternoon, I'm deekshana goud.In my view today's session was interesting.We've learnt about github,gitpodoi and many other things. 
github is a platform,where we can store and share the codes. and gitpod oi is a server.
we've learnt about the bridges between database and the api and the whole process 
front end and back end applications were explained like front end consist of html,css and javascript which comes under front end
back end applications are java,c++ and python these applications comes under back end .
i think we've tried to perform our exam well. it didnt went good in the morning but after the explanation, I've got my answers in proper way.
